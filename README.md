# SP-Assist

I maintain a large number of *.CSV files which contain part lists for various computer/tablet/cellular phones.  
In the past should one file have an error each file that listed that part number would have to checked for the 
error as well.  There could be any number of files I would have to check by hand.

SP-Assist was created to do that job for me.  It also allows me to search for specific text (whether it be a part class, part number, description or an entire line of text) in a file or run an automated "find bad part class" task that will--find bad part classes.

Turns out this is useful to people other than myself.  Since Java will soon be required on all company PCs I've switch over to that.
